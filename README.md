Permissions for Android M(SDk>=23)

It is a new behaviour introduced in Marshmallow 6.0.1.
Every app that requests the SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission and that is installed through the Play Store (version 6.0.5 or higher is required), will have granted the permission automatically.
If instead the app is sideloaded, the permission is not automatically granted. You can try to download and install the Evernote APK from apkmirror.com. As you can see you need to manually grant the permission in Settings -> Apps -> Settings -> Draw over other apps

Additional Library used - NIL except the telegram API
